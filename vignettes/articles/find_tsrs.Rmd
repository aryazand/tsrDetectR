Here we are creating a vignette demonstrating how to call and compare Transcription Start Regions (TSRs) between across samples in an experiment. There are 4 steps to do this:

1.  Load samples as BAM files as 5' coverage

2.  Normalize 5' coverage to make samples comparable [*Note:* how to normalize files depends on biological question]

3.  Identify a set of TSRs

    a.  Use some *Peak Calling Algorithm* to call TSRs in each sample individually [Note: multiple peak calling algorithms exist, these will be discussed in this document]
    b.  Filter low quality peaks
    c.  Consolidate peaks across samples

4.  Compare the set of TSRs across samples
